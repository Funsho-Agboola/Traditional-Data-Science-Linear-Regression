# Machine-Learning-Linear-Regression
This repository contains data and models to fit and train them.

Using Sklearn, I created a linear regression model to fit the Car Sales data depending on its specification. I had to preprocess (clean) the data, relax assumptions, use log transformation, create our model and create dummies.
The Objective is to predict the price of a used car depending on its specification and then compare our results and predictions.
